                <small>March 13th, 2024</small> 
                <p>Posted my first video to Tiktok and Instagram, received little to no views, 
                    but it lit a spark of intrinsic motivation within me. Started posting daily basketball content
                    just to practice consistency. Found so much love in the editing and filming.
